# Realtime COVID-19 Data Fetcher and Notifier
This repository contains two python scripts, one to get COVID-19 update notifications in real-time **(notifier.py)** and the other one to fetch COVID-19 data of all states in India **(datafetcher.py)**. You can also save it in a CSV file.
It also has a frontend page **(index.html)** that displays COVID-19 precautions. You can download the COVID-19 notifier and data fetcher script from here. You can also navigate to the map **(map.html)** which displays a real-time COVID-19 update across the world. If you wish to see the map please let the page load for atleast 1 minute
The red markers indicate the places where the virus becomes severe.
