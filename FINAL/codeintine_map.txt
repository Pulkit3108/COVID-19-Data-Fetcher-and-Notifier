For creating a realtime corona map we used Js Mapbox.
In function updateMap() we fetched data from covid-19 data set from various websites.
Then we took their latitude and longitude to display on map.
Also we wrote a condition regarding corona cases so that we can show places with different color markers(easyto identify).
Also we set interval for updating the data set to 20 sec.
